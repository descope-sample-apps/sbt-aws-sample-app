### **What is the SaaS Builder Toolkit (SBT)?**

The **SaaS Builder Toolkit (SBT)** is an open-source developer toolkit designed to help you implement SaaS best practices and increase developer velocity. Built on top of the AWS Cloud Development Kit (CDK), SBT provides high-level abstractions and reusable infrastructure constructs that encapsulate SaaS principles.

---

### Backend Setup (AWS SBT)

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/descope-sample-apps/aws-sbt-sample-app
   cd aws-descope-sbt-sample/cdk-example
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Define SaaS Resources**:

   > You'll need to ensure that you're signed in with the correct AWS credentials in the CLI before you do this step. Also make sure that your Docker Daemon is running.

   Update the CDK stack to use AWS SBT constructs for SaaS resource provisioning.

4. **Deploy CDK Stack**:
   ```bash
   cdk deploy
   ```

5. Save the **API Gateway URL** from the output for later use.

   NEXT_PUBLIC_DESCOPE_PROJECT_ID="<Your Descope Project ID>"
   NEXT_PUBLIC_DESCOPE_FLOW_ID="<Your Descope Flow ID>"

   # AWS SBT URL
   NEXT_PUBLIC_AWS_URL="<Your API Gateway URL>"
   ```

4. **Run the Application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```
