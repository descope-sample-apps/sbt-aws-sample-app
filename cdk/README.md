# CDK Project for Descope and AWS SBT Integration

This project demonstrates how to deploy an AWS CDK application written in TypeScript. The CDK stack provisions resources required for integrating **Descope** and **AWS SaaS Builder Toolkit (SBT)**.

The `cdk.json` file specifies how the CDK Toolkit should execute your app.

---

## üìÇ Project Structure

- **`bin/`**: Entry point for your CDK app.
- **`lib/`**: Contains the CDK stack definitions.
- **`cdk.json`**: Configures the CDK CLI for this project.

---

## üîß Prerequisites

Before running the CDK commands, ensure you have:

1. **Node.js**: Install the latest LTS version of Node.js.
2. **AWS CLI**: Install and configure the AWS CLI with credentials for the target account.
3. **CDK Toolkit**: Install the AWS CDK globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g aws-cdk
   ```
4. **Dependencies**: Install the project dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

### **1. Build the Project**
Compile TypeScript to JavaScript:
```bash
npm run build
```

### **2. Synthesize the CloudFormation Template**
Generate a CloudFormation template based on your CDK app:
```bash
npx cdk synth
```

### **3. Deploy the CDK Stack**
Deploy the stack to your default AWS account and region:
```bash
npx cdk deploy
```

- You‚Äôll be prompted to confirm changes if any IAM resources are created or updated.

| `npx cdk diff`        | Compare the deployed stack with your local changes to understand what will be updated.      |
| `npx cdk destroy`     | Destroy the deployed stack, removing all AWS resources.                                     |

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Workflow

1. **Make Changes**:
   Modify your CDK stack in the `lib/` directory.

2. **Build**:
   Compile the TypeScript changes:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Test Locally**:
   Validate the synthesized CloudFormation template:
   ```bash
   npx cdk synth
   ```

4. **Deploy**:
   Deploy your updated stack:
   ```bash
   npx cdk deploy
   ```
